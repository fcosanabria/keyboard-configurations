My list of keyboards using QMK Firmware and UHK Agent or any other configuration software.

## Keyboards

- UHK Version 2, 1x 60% split keyboard
- MNT Reform 75%? keyboard
- HHKB Professional Hybrid
- Tex Shinobi

### UHK Version 2

The UHK is A fully programmable, impeccably built, open source, split mechanical keyboard designed for extreme productivity and ergonomics. It does not support QMK Firmware, but it has its own configuration software called [UHK Agent](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/agent) which is as powerful as QMK. Even better UI and easier to use.

### MNT Reform

The [MNT Reform](https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform-usb-keyboard-standalone) keyboard is a compact and slim mechanical keyboard designed for comfort and portability. It support both QMK and it's own [MNT Reform 2.0 Keyboard Firmware](https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform/-/tree/master/reform2-keyboard-fw). I use the QMK version. Soon I will have a look on how to use their own firmware to configure the OLED display.

My favorite video so far is from [Wolfgang's Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zUenHY3Bws)

### HHKB Professional Hybrid

The [HHKB Professional Hybrid](https://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/hhkeyboard/hhkbprohybrid/) is a 60% keyboard with topre switches. It is one of my favorite keyboards, but it's software is not very flexible.

#### Dip Switches Configuration

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|ON |OFF|OFF|OFF|ON |ON |

> The dip switches are located on the back of the keyboard. Check the manual/documentation for more information.

You can use the [HHKB Layout Editor](https://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/hhkeyboard/hhkbprohybrid/layouteditor/) to configure the layout.
